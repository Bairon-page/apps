In part 2, we'll modify the existing code by accepting user input to make it more interactive.\n\nLet's start with the first question.\n\n1. Remove the line where you declare the `name` variable and assign it a value.\n2. Add `input` function to capture the user's input and add `\"Hello! What is your name? \"` as the argument between the parentheses.\n\nRun the program and enter your name when prompted in the console. You'll see the program stops and waits for the user's input when using the `input` function.\n\nAlso, note that we can leave a space in the prompt used in the `input` function to make it easier for our user to type in their name, as we then have a whitespace between the question mark and the start of the user's text.",
